# send2cgeo_addon
Browser addon (Firefox &amp; Chrome) for using send2cgeo feature of [c:geo](http://www.cgeo.org/)

# Why?

[send2cgeo](http://www.cgeo.org/send2cgeo.html) is currently available by Greasmonkey (Firefox) and Tampermonkey (Chrome) userscripts.
If a user is using any of it reguraly, then it is easy to install and use deticated userscript.
But in some cases user might not want (myself included) to install this addon or it's not sure how it works.

In such cases, deticated addon is a solution and here it is.
